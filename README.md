# Movie-recommender-system

Recommendation Systems in the world of machine learning have become very popular and are a huge advantage to tech giants like Netflix, Amazon and many more to target their content to a specific audience. These recommendation engines are so strong in their predictions that they can dynamically alter the state of what the user sees on their page based on the userâ€™s interaction with the app.

I've made a movie recommender system based on content rating of various movies.
The Recommender offers generalized recommnendations to every user based on movie popularity and (sometimes) genre. The basic idea behind this recommender is that movies that are more popular and more critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience. This model does not give personalized recommendations based on the user.

The files available above are the primary code files used to make the machine learning model along with the dataset used in making the model.
